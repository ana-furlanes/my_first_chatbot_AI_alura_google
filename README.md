# My First AI Chatbot: A Challenging Journey in the Alura Google Immersion! 🤖
>
> I had the opportunity to participate in the AI Immersion promoted by Alura + Google, learn technological concepts such as prompt engineering,  good practices, Python, and so on.
>
>With this immersion, I was able to create my first chatbot. It’s simple, but since I’m not in the programming area, but Technical Writer, it’s already a great challenge!

🧠 **The Alura Google Immersion provided me with the essential tools**: Natural Language Processing (NLP): To teach he chatbot how to understand and interpret human language. 

🗣️ **Language Models**: To empower the chatbot to generate criative and contextually appropriate responses.

### Source of documentation used to create the chatbot:
- https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart?hl=pt-br

_My chatbot is able to help people quickly resolve issues, whether day to day, or even be more complex issues._ 

## 🤝 Join me on this adventure!

And feel free to cotribute to my project, since I’m not in the programming area and used Python for the first time!

Bye, see you.
